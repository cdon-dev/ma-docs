Welcome to the documentation of the CDON Marketplace merchant integration!

Marketplace has a number of **APIs** for system integration, and also an **administration** page for manual management.

.. note::
	To use either an API or the administration pages, you need to have a valid account with CDON Marketplace.

The APIs make it possible for merchants to send and receive data via HTTP to manage their inventory and orders. Communication with the APIs is not restricted to any specific programming language. However, the data exchange must be formatted in the right way, which is described in these documents.
