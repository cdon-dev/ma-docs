# Integration

Deliveries are made to Marketplace by posting **XML**-formatted data to the endpoint for the corresponding [data type](../data-types.md).

Responses are returned with a HTTP status code and possibly a body in **JSON**-format.

The [receipt](../receipts.md) received can be used to [track](../tracking.md) the progress of the delivery.
