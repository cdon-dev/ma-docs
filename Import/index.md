# Introduction

By exporting your inventory to CDON Marketplace, your products will be added to the CDON product catalog, which makes them available to CDON's customers.

In the CDON Marketplace import process, there are two vital key concepts; **data types** and **receipts**. Data is accepted in different types to populate a product with necessary information, whereas the receipt is used to track the progress of the import. The diagram below illustrates the main concept of a delivery.
